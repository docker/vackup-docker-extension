  - To a compressed file in your local filesystem
  - To an existing local image
  - To a new local image
- To a new image in Docker Hub (or another registry)
- Import data into a new container or into an existing container:
  - From a compressed file in your local filesystem
  - From an existing image
  - From an existing image in Docker Hub (or another registry)
- Transfer a volume via SSH to another host that runs Docker Desktop or Docker engine.
- Clone a volume
- Empty a volume
- Delete a volume
## Installation

Install Docker Extension with the [Extensions CLI](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/extensions-sdk/#prerequisites).

```bash
  docker extension install docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest
```

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/docker/vackup-docker-extension.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd volumes-backup-extension
```

Build the extension

```bash
  docker build -t docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest .
```

Install the extension

```bash
  docker extension install docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest
```

Developing the frontend

```bash
  cd ui
  npm install
  npm start
```

This starts a development server that listens on port 3000.

You can now tell Docker Desktop to use this as the frontend source. In another terminal run:

```bash
  docker extension dev ui-source docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest http://localhost:3000
```

In order to open the Chrome Dev Tools for your extension when you click on the extension tab, run:

```bash
  docker extension dev debug docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest
```

Each subsequent click on the extension tab will also open Chrome Dev Tools. To stop this behaviour, run:

```bash
  docker extension dev reset docker/volumes-backup-extension:latest
```
